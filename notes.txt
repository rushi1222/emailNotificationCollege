Implementing persistence in GitHub Actions for a variable like previous_hash typically involves storing the value somewhere it can be retrieved from on subsequent runs. Options include:

Artifacts: Saving the hash to a file and uploading it as an artifact, then downloading it on the next run.
Cache: Using GitHub's cache to store and retrieve the hash.
External Services: Using an external service like a database, a key-value store (like Redis), or even a simple storage solution like AWS S3 or GitHub Gists.
For simplicity, here's an example using GitHub Gists to store the previous_hash:

Step 1: Create a GitHub Gist
Create a Gist on GitHub to store your hash. You'll need to save the Gist ID, which can be found in the Gist's URL.

Step 2: Update Your Python Script
Modify your Python script to download the hash from the Gist before it runs the check and upload the new hash after the check.

Here's a simplified version of how you might adjust your code. You will need to install and import requests to handle HTTP requests:

python
Copy code
import requests

GIST_ID = 'your_gist_id_here'
GIST_FILENAME = 'hash.txt'
GITHUB_TOKEN = 'your_github_token_here'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'token {GITHUB_TOKEN}'
}

def get_previous_hash():
    # Get the content of the gist file
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.github.com/gists/{GIST_ID}', headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        gist_content = response.json()
        return gist_content['files'][GIST_FILENAME]['content']
    else:
        return None

def set_previous_hash(hash_value):
    # Update the gist file with the new hash
    data = {
        'files': {
            GIST_FILENAME: {
                'content': hash_value
            }
        }
    }
    response = requests.patch(f'https://api.github.com/gists/{GIST_ID}', headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.status_code == 200

# In your main or wherever you call `check_div_change`:
previous_hash = get_previous_hash()  # Retrieves the previous hash at the start
# ... Run your checks
set_previous_hash(current_hash)  # Updates the hash after checks
Make sure to replace 'your_gist_id_here' with your actual Gist ID and 'your_github_token_here' with a valid GitHub token that has permissions to update Gists.

Step 3: Update GitHub Action Workflow
Make sure your GitHub Action workflow sets the GITHUB_TOKEN as an environment variable so it can be accessed by the script.

yaml
Copy code
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
Note: GitHub automatically creates a GITHUB_TOKEN secret to use in your workflow. You can use this token to authenticate in your workflow run.

Step 4: Test Your Setup
Trigger your GitHub Actions workflow and verify that it's able to retrieve and update the hash on the Gist.

Keep in mind that this is a basic implementation and might need to be adjusted based on the exact requirements and security practices you wish to follow, especially with regards to handling access tokens securely.
